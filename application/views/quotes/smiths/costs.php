<h2>Design and Build Costs</h2>

<p>To design and build a site with the following features</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Custom Content Management System (£800)</li>
	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Professional standards compliant responsive HTML5 design (£800)</li>
	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> About Page (£150)</li>

	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Menu Page (£150)</li>
	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Other basic pages (£150 each)</li>
</ul>

<p>The site will include the facility to sign up to an email newsletter. A marketing service such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> or similar
	is ideal for this, and can provide data on the success of email campaigns.</p>

<p>We are also a Google Apps reseller, so if you haven't already got a professional email service in place we can set this up and provide one to one training in the services it
	can provide. Google Apps costs £3.30 per user per month.</p>
	
	<p>Client site visits will be charged at £30 per hour </p>
