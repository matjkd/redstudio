<p>The site will include the facility to sign up to a newsletter. Newsletter service will likely be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> or similar
	which is free to use up to a point, but there is an additional charge if you send more than a certain amount of mail.</p>

<p>We are also a Google Apps reseller, so if you haven't already got a professional email service in place we can set this up and provide one to one training in the services it
	can provide. Google Apps costs £3.30 per user per month.</p>
