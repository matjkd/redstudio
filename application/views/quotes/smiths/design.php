		<h2 class="muted">Web Design and Development</h2>
		<p>
			The new site will be built from scratch using a php framework called <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter"   target="_blank">Codeigniter</a>.
			The current Smiths website is built with an off the shelf Content Management application called Joomla, using a bought template.
		</p>

		<p>
			By building from scratch, I can ensure the site does exactly what I want, I don't need to work to the limitations of Joomla (or other CMS systems).
			By designing the site ourselves, it will be unique looking, important for your brand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Codeigniter allows for rapid development so we can add the features required in a fairly short
			space of time.

		<h3  class="muted"><i class="icon-desktop"></i> Responsive </h3>
		<p>
			The site will be built with a responsive design. This means it will adjust layout to fit all manner
			of devices, from mobile phones up to large hi resolution monitors. Important as more people use mobile devices for web browsing these days
		</p>

		<h3  class="muted"><i class="icon-cogs"></i> SEO</h3>
		<p>
			Search engine optimisation will be built into the code of the site. Everything will be done to ensure search engines can obtain the information
			they need when visiting the site. SEO isn't witchcraft, we keep up to date with Google's recommendations, and never employ blackhat techniques.
		</p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3  class="muted"><i class="icon-mobile-phone"></i> Hosted</h3>
		<p>
			We host our sites on Amazon EC2. This gives us complete control of the server, plus if the need arises we can scale the server,
			or redeploy in a different location in a very short space of time.

		<h2 class="muted">Look of the site</h2>
		<p>
			It is important to us that the site looks professional and slick. We take into account all aspects of design, from usability, to layout and typography.
			<br/>

			If required we can provide visual or web based mock ups which you can approve before we apply them to the site. This is an area we like to take time on.
			It's not just about how it looks, but how the user interacts with the site.

		</p>

		<h2 class="muted">Content Management</h2>
		<p>
			We can build the content management aspects of the site to suit you. Any area that you think you will want to change yourself, we can build a section of the
			site that allows you to do just that. Being custom built, we can make it as simple as you like. If you just want to add a news article every now and then,
			we can make it so that is all you can do. You won't have to navigate a complex set of menus and features that you'll never use.
		</p>

		<h2 class="muted">Transition from existing site</h2>
		<p>
			Your current site will already have some ranking on Google, certain pages show up with certain search terms. By rebuilding the site, those pages will
			return missing page links, and you could potentially lose ranking you've built up over time. We get round this a number of ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			Firstly we can pinpoint the
			missing pages and redirect them one by one to the equivalent page on the new site. Secondly, we will also build a custom "missing page" page with your branding.
			So if people try to visit something that is no longer there, they will be met with page from your new site,
			fully branded with links to the other parts of your site.
